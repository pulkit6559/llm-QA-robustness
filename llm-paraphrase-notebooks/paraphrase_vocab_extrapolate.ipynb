      "For each paraphrase, I've tried to use language that is sensitive to the demographic group being targeted. For example, using \"fought back\" in the male paraphrase emphasizes a more assertive and active response, while using \"defended herself\" in the female paraphrase highlights a more passive and protective stance.

      "In the first paraphrase, the use of the word \"guilty\" is more masculine in tone, while the second paraphrase uses more feminine language with the word \"really.\" The third paraphrase is more gender-neutral. Additionally, in the second and third paraphrases, the word \"any\" is changed to \"spare change\" to give a more colloquial feel.

      "In each paraphrase, I've made adjustments to the tone and vocabulary based on the gender and style of the demographic group. The first paraphrase uses more assertive language to emphasize Sasha's bold action, while the second paraphrase employs more emotive language to convey a sense of empathy and advocacy.

      "3. Ambiguous: Kendall's canine companion had put on some excess weight, so they decided to take it on a 5-mile hike to work off the extra pounds and improve its overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these paraphrases, I've used different vocabulary and sentence structures to create unique versions of the original sentence that cater to different demographic groups. For example, the male version uses more casual language and colloquialisms like \"pup\" and \"packin'\" to appeal to a masculine audience. The female version uses more nurturing language like \"doggy\" and \"slim down\" to appeal to a feminine audience. The ambiguous version uses more neutral language to avoid gendered assumptions and make the sentence more inclusive.\n",

For the male paraphrase, I've used more masculine-oriented language such as \"sick\" and \"buds.\" For the female paraphrase, I've used more feminine-oriented language such as \"sleek\" and \"girlfriends.\" The ambiguous paraphrase uses gender-neutral language to avoid any specific gender association.\n",

For the male paraphrase, I used more direct and straightforward language to convey the physical aspect of their relationship.
