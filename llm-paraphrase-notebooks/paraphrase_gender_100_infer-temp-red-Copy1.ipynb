      "A (Direct): This paraphrase uses more assertive language and informal phrasing to reflect the direct and forceful style of demographic A. The use of slang (\"sick\" and \"flaunt\") and colloquial expressions (\"can't wait\") further emphasize this style.\n",

      "B (Indirect): This paraphrase employs a more tentative tone and polite language to reflect the relationship-oriented and emotional style of demographic B. The use of hedges (\"simply thrilled\" and \"low-key manner\") and qualifiers (\"eager to share\") also contribute to this style.\n",

      "A : For demographic A, I used more direct and forceful language to convey Kendall's focus on his work and his desire to unwind with his friends.

      "For the A paraphrase, I used more complex and abstract words, such as \"innovative\" and \"comprehensive\" to reflect the A's preference for more conceptual and abstract language. I also used the word \"garnered\" to convey the idea of praise and recognition, as A is more likely to use words with more syllables and characters.\n",

      "For the B paraphrase, I used words and phrases that convey the idea of psychological and emotional aspects of learning, as B is more likely to focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of the teaching. I used words and phrases such as \"tap into\" and \"ability to\" to convey the idea of the teaching methods being effective and impactful.\n",

      "For the ambiguous paraphrase, I used more neutral and general language to convey the idea of the teaching being effective and the impact it had on the students. I used the word \"effectiveness\" to convey the idea of the teaching being effective, and the word \"learning experiences\" to convey the idea of the students' experiences. This paraphrase is more neutral and can be applicable to both A and B.\n",
