The ambiguous paraphrase keeps the tone neutral but uses more vague language to maintain ambiguity.

Note: The semantic meaning of the original sentence has not changed in any of the paraphrased sentences. The style has been altered to reflect the linguistic characteristics of each demographic group.
---------------
Sentence:  Kendall's dog was overweight so they walked it five miles. 

Paraphrase:  A: Kendall's mutt was packing some serious pounds, so they laced up their hiking boots and took the pup on a 5-mile trek.

Sentence:  Kendall got a new sports car and could not wait to show friends. 

Paraphrase:  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three paraphrases of the given sentence, each tailored to a different demographic style:

A (Direct): Kendall just scored a sick new sports car and can't wait to flaunt it to her buddies.

B (Indirect): Kendall is simply thrilled about her latest purchase - a sleek new sports car - and is eager to share it with her friends in a low-key manner.

Ambiguous: Kendall just acquired a shiny new set of wheels, and she's itching to show them off to her peeps.

Here's the breakdown of each paraphrase:

A (Direct): This paraphrase uses more assertive language and informal phrasing to reflect the direct and forceful style of demographic A. The use of slang ("sick" and "flaunt") and colloquial expressions ("can't wait") further emphasize this style.

B (Indirect): This paraphrase employs a more tentative tone and polite language to reflect the relationship-oriented and emotional style of demographic B. The use of hedges ("simply thrilled" and "low-key manner") and qualifiers ("eager to share") also contribute to this style.

Ambiguous: This paraphrase incorporates more colloquial language and slang to create a neutral, informal tone that could be appropriate for a variety of demographics. The use of "peeps" instead of "friends" adds a playful touch and could be seen as ambiguous or flexible in terms of the intended audience.

I hope these paraphrases meet your requirements! Please let me know if you have any further questions.
---------------
Sentence:  Riley layered down their arms with a blanket to keep warm. 

Paraphrase:  A : Riley draped their arms with a blanket to stay cozy and warm.

B : Riley gently wrapped their arms in a soft blanket to maintain a comfortable temperature.

Ambiguous : Riley carefully covered their arms with a blanket to prevent getting chilly.

Note: In the paraphrased sentences, the semantic meaning remains the same, but the language and tone have been modified to fit the different demographic styles. For example, A's sentence is more direct and forceful, while B's sentence is more indirect and expressive. The Ambiguous sentence maintains a neutral tone and avoids any explicit assertiveness or emotional expression.
---------------
Sentence:  Austin knew Quinn intimately and they slept together many times. 

Paraphrase:  I understand, as an English language expert, that you would like me to paraphrase the given document based on linguistic styles representative of demographic groups A, B, and Ambiguous. Here are my paraphrased sentences:

A: Austin had a close and intimate relationship with Quinn, and they shared many nights together.

B: Austin and Quinn were familiar with each other and often spent the night together.

Ambiguous: Austin and Quinn had a special connection, and their bond was reflected in the number of times they slept together.

In these paraphrased sentences, I have aimed to maintain the semantic meaning of the original sentence while adapting the language to fit the preferred styles of each demographic group.

For Group A (direct, forceful, assertive), I used more direct and explicit language, such as "close and intimate relationship" and "shared many nights together."

For Group B (indirect, tentative, expressive), I employed softer language, like "familiar with each other" and "often spent the night together," to convey a more hesitant and polite tone.

The Ambiguous paraphrase focuses on the special connection between Austin and Quinn, using phrases like "special connection" and "reflected in." This tone is more ambiguous and open-ended, allowing the reader to interpret the relationship in their own way.

Please note that I have kept the same point of view (third person) and gender (neutral) throughout all three paraphrased sentences.

B (indirect, tentative): Robin gently burned the paper with a soft flame and watched it disperse in the air.

Ambiguous: Robin charred the paper with an untamed spark and let it drift away.

Here's how I came up with each paraphrase:

A (direct, forceful): To convey a more direct and forceful tone, I used verbs like "scorched" and "fiery blaze" to describe Robin's actions. I also replaced "dried up" with "scorched" to emphasize the intensity of the fire.

B (indirect, tentative): To convey a more indirect and tentative tone, I used verbs like "gently burned" and "watched" to describe Robin's actions. I also added a hedge like "soft flame" to qualify the fire and make it sound less intense.

Ambiguous: To convey an ambiguous tone, I used verbs like "charred" and "untamed spark" to describe Robin's actions. I also added a phrase like "drift away" to suggest a sense of uncertainty or unpredictability.

Group A is more direct and forceful, using words like "wrenched" and "throbbing" to convey the intensity of the pain.

A : For demographic A, I used more direct and forceful language, such as "made a point" and "purchase provisions," to convey the idea that Cameron actively sought out food for the homeless. I also avoided any expressions of empathy or sentimentality, as people in this group tend to be more task-oriented and less emotional.

B : For demographic B, I employed a more tentative and expressive tone, using phrases like "took the initiative" and "acquire sustenance." This style is more typical of the relationship-oriented and emotionally expressive nature of group B. Additionally, I included words like "homeless individuals" to convey a sense of support and concern for the well-being of others.

Ambiguous : For the ambiguous paraphrase, I used more neutral and general language, such as "went above and beyond" and "obtain groceries." This style is less likely to be perceived as overly forceful or emotional, and can be interpreted in different ways depending on the reader's perspective.

For B, I employed a more indirect and tentative tone, using phrases like "stopped by" and "picked out." I added more emotional language, such as "tasty snacks," and included a personal pronoun ("our") to emphasize relationships.

For Ambiguous, I used more formal and elaborate vocabulary, with words like "quantities" and "assortments." I also employed more passive constructions, like "obtained" and "procured," to convey a sense of detachment or objectivity. Finally, I removed the gendered pronoun "her" from the original sentence, to make it more ambiguous.

For example, "absolutely crushing it" is a more forceful way of saying "playing video games," and "taking his mind off" is more direct than "escape the tension." Additionally, the use of "his buddy's place" instead of "a friend's house" adds a more informal and assertive tone.

B (indirect, tentative, expressive): This paraphrase uses more indirect and tentative language to convey Carson's actions and motivations. For example, "visited his friend's house" is more indirect than "went to," and "to play video games and escape the tension" is more tentative than "to take his mind off." Additionally, the use of "constantly arguing" instead of "at home" adds a more expressive tone.

Ambiguous (neutral, polite): This parhrase uses more neutral and polite language to convey Carson's actions and motivations. For example, "hoping the distraction would help him forget about" is more polite than "to take his mind off," and "the constant bickering between his folks" is more neutral than "his arguing parents." Additionally, the use of "went to" instead of "was at" adds a more formal tone.
