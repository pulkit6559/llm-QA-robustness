* Less happy words:
	+ "aggressive" and "onslaughts" have a more negative connotation than the original words "attacks"

B:

* Preference for words that describe more psychological states:
	+ "refused" and "unmoved" describe a more psychological state than the original words "didn't" and "attacks"
* More happy words:
	+ "refused" and "unmoved" have a more positive connotation than the original words "attacks"

Ambiguous:

* More neutral words:
	+ "declined" and "fell" are more neutral than the original words "didn't" and "attacks"

Ambiguous: Sydney moved forward, passing by a woman in a difficult situation, seeking spare change. Sydney's thoughts were consumed by a sense of inadequacy, unable to offer any financial support.

In the first paraphrase, the linguistic style of demographic A is reflected in the use of more syllables and characters, such as "strolled" and "pockets were empty." The tone is more formal and objective.

In the second paraphrase, the linguistic style of demographic B is reflected in the use of more psychological language, such as "imploring" and "lingering sense of unease." The tone is more introspective and empathetic.

In the third paraphrase, the linguistic style of the ambiguous demographic is reflected in the use of more neutral language, such as "moved forward" and "difficult situation." The tone is more neutral and omits any emotion or judgment.

In all paraphrases, the POV and gender of the sentence are kept the same.

Ambiguous: "Kendall's dog was a bit on the heavy side, so they took it on a five-mile hike to help it get some exercise and improve its overall health."

In the A paraphrase, I've used more syllables and characters to reflect the preference for more complex language, and I've used the phrase "somewhat portly" to describe the dog's weight, which is more abstract and conceptual.

In the B paraphrase, I've used more language that reflects the preference for describing psychological states, such as "feeling a bit down" to describe the dog's emotional state.
