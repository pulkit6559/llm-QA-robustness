Ambiguous: Carson's lips brushed against Alex's cheek, and a whispered invitation for dinner left Alex's heart fluttering, the tone and intentions left open for interpretation.

For the ambiguous paraphrase, I've left the tone and intentions open for interpretation, as the original sentence is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.
